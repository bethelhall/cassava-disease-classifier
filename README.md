# cassava-disease-classifier
As the 2nd largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by small-holder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of small-holder farmer households in Sub-Saharan Africa grow cassava and viral diseases are major sources of poor yields.
The dataset consists of leaf images of the cassava plant, with 9,436 annotated images and 12,595 unlabeled images of cassava leaves.
The model is built using Tensorflow's Model API and has an accuracy of 98.5%. The model classifies pictures of cassava leaves into 1 of 4 disease categories (or healthy)
